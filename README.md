Pitchfork on Twitter is a quantitative user research project that explores Pitchfork's reviewer scores of 21447 indie music albums in the past ten years and around 3200 official tweets using Python, Tableau and D3 plus. This project was conducted in Spring 2016.

Who are the most popular mentioned-users and artists on Pitchfork's official twitter account? Are these artists also Pitchforksâ€™ favorites? Simply put, do Pitchfork fans' social media presence and music opinions really get affected by this tiny web outfit? Apart from answering these questions, I also visualized Pitchfork's twitter network, which demonstrates how the artists, record labels, music festivals, and even politicians get connected together in this online indie music world.
